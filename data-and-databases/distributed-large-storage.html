            <li>Hadoop is the leading platform for petabyte scale distributed data storage and processing. It is designed to detect and manage failures in commodity compute nodes, thus not relying on expensive high-availability hardware. Compatible with MapReduce APIs.</li>
            <li>During 2001, several commercial offering provide support around Hadoop components, or Hadoop-like components, including from EMC, Oracle and IBM.</li>
            <li>HBase is modelled after Google’s distributed database BigTable.</li>
            <li>Cassandra developed and open sourced by Facebook provides faster large storage balanced by “eventual consistency”. It follows the NoSQL concept. The multi-master architecture has no single points of failure, and zero-downtime failed node replacement. Designed for highly consistent durable storage through data centre failures.</li>
            <li>Redis NoSQL store is governed by VMWare</li>
