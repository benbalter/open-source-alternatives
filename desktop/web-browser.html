            <li>Firefox, which grew out of the Mozilla/Netscape efforts, became the leading browser noted for its standards compliance.</li>

            <li>Historically, Internet Explorer has been considered by many not be as standards compliant as alternative browsers. Its use of ActiveX as a mechanism has led some to consider it to have a greater attack surface. It is best practice for web developers to test against a range of browsers, with IE-only support considered bad practice.</li>
